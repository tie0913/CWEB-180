Q:What happens during a TLS handshake?
O:The client and server negotiate network congestion management.
O:The server and client agree on a data compression method.
OR:The server provides its digital certificate to the client for authentication.
O:The server's processing load is reduced.

Q:What is it called when a system's clock begins to be off by a few seconds or even minutes?
O:Dispersion
O:Slew
O:Slam
OR:Time drift

Q:What can happen if a server or host is configured with the incorrect time?
O:It will automatically correct itself without NTP
O:It can lead to increased network speed
O:It will increase the security of network communications
OR:It may not be able to access network services

Q:You are the network administrator for a small consulting firm. You've set up an NTP server to manage the time across all the machines in the network.
Q:You have a computer that's experiencing a slight time drift of just a few seconds.
Q:Which time correction should you use to fix the system's clock?
O:Skew
OR:Slew
O:Slam
O:Jitter

Q:Which of the following time standards does NTP use?
QR:UTC
O:PDT
O:CDT
O:EDT

Q:What role does a grandmaster clock play in a PTP domain?
O:It serves as the primary network router.
OR:It is the authoritative time source.
O:It synchronizes directly with satellite clocks.
O:It acts as the primary backup time source.

Q::PTP can be deployed as a layer 3 protocol over IP. What is a limitation of this deployment?
O:It requires additional satellite synchronization.
OR:It cannot achieve the same accuracy as layer 2 implementations.
O:It is incompatible with most network adapters.
O:It increases the network bandwidth usage significantly.

Q:What is the main advantage of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) over Network Time Protocol (NTP)?
O:PTP supports more network services.
OR:PTP provides nanosecond precision.
O:PTP uses less network bandwidth.
O:PTP is easier to implement.
